= Sinatra Example

This is a simple todo server example that we use to run our Cucumber tests against
to ensure that the SDK is operating as expected. Please read the `application.rb`
for details on how it works, it is fairly simple.

It can be built into a Passenger dockerfile using the `build.sh` script and started
using `docker_start.sh`
